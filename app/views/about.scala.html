<p>See <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/bodik.org/cs164/" target="_blank">CS164: Hack Your Language!</a> and 
related YouTube lectures for information about these. The link to PA1 includes test programs that the Parser/Interpreter 
will run.
</p><br/>

<p>The Calculator functionality is inspired by the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#reference" target="_blank">Google Calculator</a>, though I'm sure the 
implementation is quite different.
</p><br/>
<p>
This tool will evaluate expressions using SI or other convertible units and return the results in whatever units
you require. For example, suppose you have the word problem, <q>an object is traveling
100 feet every 3 seconds -- how far, in miles, will travel in one hour?</q> 
Simply ask the calculator to evaluate 
<q>(100 ft / 3 s) * 1 hr in mi</q> and it will return the result <q>22.72 mi</q>. Cool, huh?
</p><br/>

<p>Parsing does not rely on spaces between values, units, and operators, nor does it rely on parentheses, 
so <q>100ft/3s*1hr in mi</q> works just as well. Units are also optional, so <q>1+1</q> will return
<q>2</q> as expected!
</p><br/>

<p> The math is the easy part -- the hard part is the parsing. This project demonstrates the use of 
    Scala parser-combinators for syntax-directed translation. This implementation gives separate syntax rules 
    for value expressions and units expressions, and then they are combined using multiplication.

<p>The Parser/Interpreter implements a small programming language as defined in CS164. For a given program,
the intermediate AST is shown along with the console output (from "print" and "error" statements) and the final
result (if a non-null result is returned). Unlike the Calculator, here the parser and interpretor are
separate components.

The functionality is inspired by the Google Calculator, though I'm sure the implementation is 
quite different.

This tool will evaluate expressions using SI or other convertible units and return the results
in whatever units you require. For example, suppose you have the word problem, an object is 
traveling 100 feet every 3 seconds -- how far, in miles, will travel in one hour? Simply ask 
the calculator to evaluate (100 ft / 3 s) * 1 hr in mi and it will return the result 22.72 mi. 
Cool, huh?

Parsing does not rely on spaces between values, units, and operators, nor does it rely on 
parentheses, so 100ft/3s*1hr in mi works just as well. Units are also optional, so 1+1 will 
return 2 as expected!

The math is the easy part -- the hard part is the parsing. This project demonstrates the use 
of Scala parser-combinators for syntax-directed translation. This implementation gives separate 
syntax rules for value expressions and units expressions, and then they are combined using 
multiplication.
